# Siete y Medio

This is a program that plays a Spanish version of Blackjack called Siete y Medio. The user starts with $100 and plays against the dealer. The game ends when the user is out of money, or if the dealer loses $900. The program also keeps a log of each round played and the key details of those rounds.

## Installation

Download the zip file and run the file Siete-y-Medio.cpp.

## Test cases:

Enter a bet larger than the amount of money the user has:

```
You have: $100 Enter bet: 200
```
This is an invalid input, and would prompt the user again to enter a valid input.

When the game prompts the user if they want another card, entering any input besides 'y' or 'Y' is taken as 'n'

```
Do you want another card? (y/n) p
```
This would be counted as 'n'
